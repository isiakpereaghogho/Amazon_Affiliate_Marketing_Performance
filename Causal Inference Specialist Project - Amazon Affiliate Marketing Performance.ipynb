    "### INTRODUCTION & OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive dataset provides real-world insights into Amazon Affiliate marketing performance, featuring detailed analytics on user behavior, product conversions, and revenue optimization strategies. Perfect for data scientists, marketing analysts, and e-commerce professionals looking to understand and improve affiliate marketing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PROJECT GOALS\n",
    "\n",
    "The Primary goal of the project is based on the question below: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the causal effect of traffic source, product page exposure, seasonality, and user type (new vs returning) on conversion probability and affiliate revenue in an e-commerce affiliate platform?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project also covers the following causal inference analysis questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing Analytics\n",
    "- Conversion Rate Optimization: How does exposure to high-performing product pages causally increase conversion rates relative to other pages?\n",
    "- Customer Journey Mapping: What is the causal impact of early-stage user actions (first click source or landing page) on eventual purchase completion?\n",
    "- Attribution Modeling: What is the causal contribution of each traffic source (organic, paid, social, referral) to conversions, compared to a counterfactual scenario where that source was absent?\n",
    "- Seasonal Trend Analysis: What is the causal effect of seasonal periods (e.g., holiday vs non-holiday) on conversion rates across different product categories?\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Intelligence\n",
    "- Revenue Forecasting: How does an increase in user traffic from specific sources causally affect affiliate revenue over time?\n",
    "- Product Performance: What is the causal effect of promoting specific product categories on revenue and conversion outcomes?\n",
    "- User Segmentation: How does being a returning customer (versus a new customer) causally affect conversion probability and average order value?\n",
    "- Geographic Analysis: What is the causal effect of user geographic location on conversion rates, after controlling for traffic source and product exposure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal Churn Analysis\n",
    "- Traffic Source & Churn: What is the causal effect of traffic source on the probability of user churn within 30 days?\n",
    "- Early Engagement & Churn: How does early-session engagement causally affect the likelihood of user churn?\n",
    "- Product Exposure & Churn: Does exposure to discounted or highly rated products causally reduce churn?\n",
    "\n",
